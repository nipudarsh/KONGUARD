# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest release on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you found a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report privately by:
- Opening a draft GitHub Security Advisory (preferred), or
- Emailing the maintainer (add your email/contact here)

Please include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Affected version(s)
- Screenshots/logs (if safe)

## Scope
KONGUARD is designed to be:
- Offline-first
- Read-only
- No data exfiltration

Reports should focus on violations of those guarantees or unsafe behavior.
